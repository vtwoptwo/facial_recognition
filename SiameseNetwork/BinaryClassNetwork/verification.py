    # Detection Threshold: 

    # Verification Threshold: proportion of positive predictions to be considered a match

# detect face in a video and take screenshot:  https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/face-detection-on-recorded-videos-using-opencv-in-python-windows-and-macos-407635c699

# if i train the model on images of the people and then i verify and take out the highest positive samples 
# and then take the one with the highest similarity as the output, then i can use that as a face detection

# alternatively build a model which learns face to name embeddings and then use that to detect faces
